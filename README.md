# ReVanced Repo
This repo template will allow you to build non-root ReVanced and ReVanced Music using GitHub Actions. This will help people who don't want to setup build environments on their machines.

This will build non-root ReVanced with all patches except `premium-heading`, they can be configured (or disabled) from the ReVanced settings menu in the app.

ReVanced Music will be built with these patches: `background-play`, `codecs-unlock`, `compact-header`, `custom-music-branding`, `exclusive-audio-playback`, `hide-get-premium`, `minimized-playback-music`, `music-microg-support`, `music-video-ads`, `predictive-back-gesture`, `tasteBuilder-remover` and `upgrade-button-remover`.

You can modify the `scripts/build.sh` script to choose the patches you want. A list of available patches and their descriptions can be found [here](https://github.com/LeddaZ/revanced-patches).
